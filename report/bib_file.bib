  abstract  = {Skill estimation mechanisms, colloquially known as rating systems, play an important role in competitive sports and games. They provide a measure of player skill, which incentivizes competitive performances and enables balanced match-ups. In this paper, we present a novel Bayesian rating system for contests with many participants. It is widely applicable to competition formats with discrete ranked matches, such as online programming competitions, obstacle courses races, and video games. The system’s simplicity allows us to prove theoretical bounds on its robustness and runtime. In addition, we show that it is incentive-compatible: a player who seeks to maximize their rating will never want to underperform. Experimentally, the rating system surpasses existing systems in prediction accuracy, and computes faster than existing systems by up to an order of magnitude.},

  abstract  = {We introduce the hyperparameter search problem in the field of machine learning and discuss its main challenges from an optimization perspective. Machine learning methods attempt to build models that capture some element of interest based on given data. Most common learning algorithms feature a set of hyperparameters that must be determined before training commences. The choice of hyperparameters can significantly affect the resulting model's performance, but determining good values can be complex; hence a disciplined, theoretically sound search strategy is essential.},

  abstract  = {Sports forecasting models â€“ beyond their interest to bettors â€“ are important resources for sports analysts and coaches. Like the best athletes, the best forecasting models should be rigorously tested and judged by how well their performance holds up against top competitors. Although a number of models have been proposed for predicting match outcomes in professional tennis, their comparative performance is largely unknown. The present paper tests the predictive performance of 11 published forecasting models for predicting the outcomes of 2395 singles matches during the 2014 season of the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour. The evaluated models fall into three categories: regression-based, point-based, and paired comparison models. Bookmaker predictions were used as a performance benchmark. Using only 1 year of prior performance data, regression models based on player ranking and an Elo approach developed by FiveThirtyEight were the most accurate approaches. The FiveThirtyEight model predictions had an accuracy of 75\% for matches of the most highly-ranked players, which was competitive with the bookmakers. The inclusion of career-to-date improved the FiveThirtyEight model predictions for lower-ranked players (from 59\% to 64\%) but did not change the performance for higher-ranked players. All models were 10â€“20 percentage points less accurate at predicting match outcomes among lower-ranked players than matches with the top players in the sport. The gap in performance according to player ranking and the simplicity of the information used in Elo ratings highlight directions for further model development that could improve the practical utility and generalizability of forecasting in tennis.},
